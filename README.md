Product Listing and Shopping Cart
This project is a web-based product listing and shopping cart system. It allows users to view products by category, add items to their cart, and navigate between different sections of the website. The cart utilizes localStorage to store selected items, ensuring the cart's contents persist even if the page is reloaded.

Add to Cart: Adds selected items to the shopping cart with data stored in the browser's localStorage.
Remove from Cart: Allows users to remove items from the cart.
Responsive Navigation: Users can navigate between different sections—Home, Shop, Blog, About, and Contact—each with customized styles.
Responsive Design: Styled using CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the website.
CSS3: Styles and layout, including hover and transition effects.
